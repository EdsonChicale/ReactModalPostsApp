# ReactModalPostsApp
This project is a simple React application for posting and viewing messages, styled with CSS modules and using React Router for navigation. Users can view a list of posts, create new posts, and view post details in a modal dialog. The app fetches and submits post data to a backend API at http://localhost:8080/posts.
